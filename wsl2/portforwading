netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport= listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport= connectaddr

Parameters explanation:

listenport: the port that Windows will listen

listenaddress: the address that your Windows will listen. Usually 0.0.0.0 should do.

connectport: the port that your Linux Distro through wsl2 will listen.

connectaddress: the public IP of your Linux wsl2 instance (found in step 1)

Use cmd or PowerShell as Administrator to run the above command.
ifconfig. hostname --all-ip-addresses

Here's a solution that is perhaps simpler than many of the others that have been offered. You need a WSL1 instance with socat installed in addition to the WSL2 instance that you're using.

On the WSL1 instance, start socat like this:

socat -d TCP-LISTEN:3000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:localhost:3000
