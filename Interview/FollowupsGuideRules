2 steps to FOLLOW UP after an INTERVIEW:

1. “Thank you” email within 24 hours of the actual interview.

2. “Follow up” email 10 BUSINESS days after the interview.

What to write?
Here are two EXAMPLES:

For:
#1 “Dear (Interviewer), Thank you very much for taking the time to see me today. I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation and I am very interested in the role. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.”

#2 (Subject line) Your name, date/time Interview.
“Dear (Interviewer), I hope this finds you well. Since I am still very interested in this role, I was wondering whether you have any feedback for me at this time, please?”

#2 can be resent every 10 business days until you get a response.

Do NOT “stalk” HR, Recruiters or Hiring Managers. Unless you want to come across as a total nut! 

Anything to add, please?
